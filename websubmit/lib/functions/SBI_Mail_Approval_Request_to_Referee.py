    This function sends an email to the referee in order to start the
    approval process related to the submission of a blog record.

    Parameters:

       * addressesDAM: email addresses of the people who will receive
                       this email (comma separated list). this
                       parameter may contain the <CATEG> string. In
                       which case the variable computed from the
                       [categformatDAM] parameter replaces this
                       string.
                       eg.:"<CATEG>-email@cern.ch"

       * categformatDAM: contains a regular expression used to compute
                         the category of the document given the
                         reference of the document.

                         "TEST-CATEGORY1-2001-001", then the computed
                         category equals "CATEGORY1"

       * titlefile: name of the file in which the title is stored.

       * directory: parameter used to create the URL to access the
                    files.
